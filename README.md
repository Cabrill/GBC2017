# GBC2017:  PowerCraft
##  Created for the [2017 Global Business Challenge](http://globalbusinesschallenge.org/)
**This project is the culmination of efforts by [Team FuTe](http://acs.aalto.fi/swd/global-business-challenge-2017-team-fute/).**
### Built with [FlatRedBall](http://flatredball.com/) using [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) and [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) in [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
*This is the public repository of our software demonstration for distribution to individuals for feedback, as well as the judges at the Global Business Challenge in Queensland, Australia.*



A presentation can be viewed on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/M1eqGe7bam4) and the project concept can be described as follows:  
provide, for free, a mobile game that gets people interested in implementing renewable energy
in their household, particularly targeting casual gamers.  Our game, PowerCraft, represents energy usage as invading waves of attackers,
allowing the player to craft a defense using renewable energy source and battery technologies.  The game is designed to offer
two alternative modes of play:  

* Arcade, which represents the main appealing draw to new players, offering gameplay similar to Clash of Clans, but instead of requiring
money to purchase in-game resources, allows the player to earn them by participating in reduced energy usage in their actual households
during peak consumption hours for their respective grids.  The game would offer long-term strategic gameplay through continuous technology
upgrades, which could be monetized through technology producers looking to gain focus on their new renewable-energy and battery products
on the market.

* Simulation,  which allows the player to simulate their actual energy usage needs by entering their monthly KWh from a recent electricity bill, 
then input their latitude and longitude to simulate the sun exposure, wind frequency/intensity and indicate access to flowing water.  For 
an even more accurate simulation, the player can enter the average usage at specific times of day to account for spikes in usage.  Once
these variables are accounted for, the player can devise a real energy solution for their actual home, and by providing tie-in
marketing to local solar/wind/hydro installers, our game could generate revenue without using intrusive ads that would disrupt gameplay.

This demo is a hybrid of both modes to demonstrate the concept, and does not accurately represent either but is intended to show our 
capability to deliver upon our vision.  It compiles to Android, Windows, and potentially MacOS/Linux/iOS dependent on the version of the
FlatRedBall SDK, but only Android was ever used during development.
